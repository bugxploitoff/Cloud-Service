All about cloud service for deployments 

## what is cloud ?
Cloud refers to a network of remote servers that are used to store, manage, and process data and applications over the internet. Cloud computing enables users to access computing resources, such as servers, storage, databases, software, and networking, on an on-demand basis, without the need for owning and maintaining the infrastructure themselves.

Cloud computing services are typically provided by third-party providers, who manage the hardware and software, while users access the services over the internet. The cloud infrastructure is highly scalable and flexible, allowing users to adjust the resources they use as needed, without having to invest in additional hardware or software.

There are several types of cloud computing services, including public, private, and hybrid clouds. Public clouds are owned and operated by third-party providers and are accessible to the general public. Private clouds are owned and operated by an organization and are typically used for internal business operations. Hybrid clouds are a combination of public and private clouds, allowing organizations to take advantage of the benefits of both.

## why we need cloud ?

- Scalability: Cloud services offer on-demand scalability, which means that businesses can easily and quickly adjust their computing resources based on their needs. This eliminates the need for costly and time-consuming hardware upgrades.

- Cost Savings: Cloud services offer cost savings as businesses only pay for the resources they use, which is much more cost-effective than purchasing and maintaining expensive hardware and software.

- Accessibility: Cloud services provide remote access to data and applications from anywhere with an internet connection, which makes it easier for employees to work from home or on the go.

- Security: Cloud services offer enhanced security features and backups, which means that businesses can be sure their data is protected and recoverable in case of a disaster.

- Collaboration: Cloud services allow multiple users to access and work on the same data or application simultaneously, which promotes collaboration and productivity.

## Type of cloud
- Public cloud: This type of cloud is owned and operated by third-party providers and is accessible to the general public over the internet. Examples of public cloud providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

- Private cloud: This type of cloud is owned and operated by a single organization and is typically used for internal business operations. Private clouds can be hosted on-premises or in a data center, and they offer greater control and customization options than public clouds.

- Hybrid cloud: This type of cloud combines public and private cloud environments, allowing organizations to take advantage of the benefits of both. Hybrid clouds can be used to balance the need for data security and control with the scalability and cost-effectiveness of public cloud resources.

- Community cloud: This type of cloud is shared by several organizations with similar interests or requirements, such as regulatory compliance or security. Community clouds offer a higher level of data security and compliance than public clouds, while still allowing for resource sharing and cost savings.

- Multi-cloud: This type of cloud involves using multiple cloud providers for different tasks or applications. Multi-cloud strategies can help organizations avoid vendor lock-in, improve resilience and redundancy, and take advantage of specialized services offered by different cloud providers.

## Type of cloud service 
1. Software-as-a-service [SAAS]
2. Platform as a service.[PAAS]
3. Infrastructure as a service. [IAAS]

## Software as a service 
Software as a Service (SaaS) is a model of software delivery in which software is provided to customers over the internet as a service. In this model, customers do not need to install or maintain software on their own computers or servers, but instead access it through a web browser or mobile application.

SaaS applications are typically hosted on the provider's servers, and the provider is responsible for maintaining the software and ensuring that it is available to users. This model is often used for business applications such as email, customer relationship management (CRM), human resources management (HRM), and enterprise resource planning (ERP).

SaaS has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its scalability, cost-effectiveness, and ease of use. It allows businesses of all sizes to access sophisticated software applications without the need for large upfront investments in hardware or software licensing fees. Additionally, SaaS providers often offer flexible pricing models that allow businesses to pay only for what they use, making it easier to manage costs and scale as needed.

## Platform as a service 
Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model that provides a platform for developers to build, run, and manage applications without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. PaaS providers offer a range of services, including application hosting, development tools, database management, and integration with other services.

With PaaS, developers can focus on building and deploying their applications quickly and easily, without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. The PaaS provider takes care of all the hardware, software, and networking required to run the application, including scalability and security.

PaaS is typically used by software developers, businesses, and enterprises to develop, test, and deploy their applications. It is particularly useful for companies that want to quickly build and deploy applications without having to invest in expensive hardware or infrastructure.

Some popular PaaS providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Beanstalk, Microsoft Azure App Service, Google Cloud Platform, and Heroku.

## Infrastructure as a service
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a cloud computing model that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. IaaS providers offer a range of services, including virtual machines, storage, networking, and other infrastructure components.

With IaaS, organizations can access and use computing resources on-demand, as needed, without having to invest in and maintain their own hardware and infrastructure. IaaS providers manage the underlying infrastructure, including servers, storage, and networking, and users pay only for the resources they use.

IaaS is particularly useful for organizations that need flexible and scalable computing resources. It allows them to quickly scale up or down based on their needs and only pay for what they use. IaaS is also useful for businesses that need to test or develop new applications without having to invest in new hardware.

Some popular IaaS providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and IBM Cloud.
