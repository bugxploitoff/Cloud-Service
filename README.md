All about cloud service for deployments 

## Type of cloud service 
1. Software-as-a-service [SAAS]
2. Platform as a service.[PAAS]
3. Infrastructure as a service. [IAAS]

## Software as a service 
Software as a Service (SaaS) is a model of software delivery in which software is provided to customers over the internet as a service. In this model, customers do not need to install or maintain software on their own computers or servers, but instead access it through a web browser or mobile application.

SaaS applications are typically hosted on the provider's servers, and the provider is responsible for maintaining the software and ensuring that it is available to users. This model is often used for business applications such as email, customer relationship management (CRM), human resources management (HRM), and enterprise resource planning (ERP).

SaaS has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its scalability, cost-effectiveness, and ease of use. It allows businesses of all sizes to access sophisticated software applications without the need for large upfront investments in hardware or software licensing fees. Additionally, SaaS providers often offer flexible pricing models that allow businesses to pay only for what they use, making it easier to manage costs and scale as needed.

## Platform as a service 
Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model that provides a platform for developers to build, run, and manage applications without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. PaaS providers offer a range of services, including application hosting, development tools, database management, and integration with other services.

With PaaS, developers can focus on building and deploying their applications quickly and easily, without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. The PaaS provider takes care of all the hardware, software, and networking required to run the application, including scalability and security.

PaaS is typically used by software developers, businesses, and enterprises to develop, test, and deploy their applications. It is particularly useful for companies that want to quickly build and deploy applications without having to invest in expensive hardware or infrastructure.

Some popular PaaS providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Beanstalk, Microsoft Azure App Service, Google Cloud Platform, and Heroku.

## Infrastructure as a service
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a cloud computing model that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. IaaS providers offer a range of services, including virtual machines, storage, networking, and other infrastructure components.

With IaaS, organizations can access and use computing resources on-demand, as needed, without having to invest in and maintain their own hardware and infrastructure. IaaS providers manage the underlying infrastructure, including servers, storage, and networking, and users pay only for the resources they use.

IaaS is particularly useful for organizations that need flexible and scalable computing resources. It allows them to quickly scale up or down based on their needs and only pay for what they use. IaaS is also useful for businesses that need to test or develop new applications without having to invest in new hardware.

Some popular IaaS providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and IBM Cloud.
